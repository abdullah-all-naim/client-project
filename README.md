# Paid Task

This was a paid task from one of my clients. This is the homepage of his website. I have to design this according to his requirements given in the figma file. It is just a simple react application. He praised me a lot seeing my work and give me a tip as he was satisfied.

## Technology Used : 

1. React js
2. Bootstrap
3. material UI
4. Ant Design

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.
